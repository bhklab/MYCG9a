# MYCG9a

## Introduction
This is a project to regenerate the pharmacogenomics analysis in this paper:
""
citation's info to be added

The script for the analysis is written in R.


----

## Dependencies:
These R packages need to be installed in order to run the analysis script:
- Biobase
- PharmacoGx
- scales
- piano
- GSA


----
## Reproducibility of the Analysis:
- Once the project is downloaded to the user computer, the user needs to navigate to the main directory of the project "MYCG9a-master".
- Inside the main directory, there is an R script file named "Script_MYC_G9a_Figures_pharmacogenomics.R". Running this script will regenerate the full pharmacogenomics analysis related to associating g9a inhibitor response with MYC regulation signatures in this paper.

**Important Note:** the user needs to set the working directory inside the script file before running it, i.e. setting the working directory to "MYCG9a-master"
